Application Overview
Pawfect Match is a sophisticated dog breed recommendation platform that combines intelligent matching algorithms with a rich breed database. The app helps users discover their ideal dog companion through an interactive questionnaire system and comprehensive breed exploration tools.

Core Architecture
Technology Stack
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript with Vite
Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL with 286+ breeds
UI: Shadcn/ui components on Radix UI
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom orange theme
State: TanStack Query for server state management
Images: Custom breed photos + TheDog API integration
Key Design Principles
Mobile-first responsive design
Progressive enhancement with fallbacks
Accessibility-first with ARIA support
Performance optimized with lazy loading and caching
User Flow Architecture
1. Homepage Journey
Landing → Hero Section with Animated Paw Prints
├── "TAKE THE QUIZ NOW" → Interactive Questionnaire
└── "Browse All Breeds" → Searchable Breed Database
2. Questionnaire Experience
The questionnaire is embedded as a component within the homepage, creating a seamless single-page experience:

Living Situation (apartment, house, farm)
Activity Level (low, moderate, high energy)
Experience Level (first-time, some experience, expert)
Family Composition (kids, other pets)
Breed Preferences (size, grooming tolerance)
3. Results & Discovery
Users receive personalized recommendations with match percentages, then can explore breeds through two distinct pathways.

Modal System Architecture
Modal Implementation Details
Your app uses a sophisticated dual-navigation system:

1. Modal Popups (Quick Preview)

Built on Radix UI Dialog primitives
Triggered from result cards and breed database
Provides quick breed overview in overlay format
Features smooth animations (fade-in + zoom-in)
Centered positioning with backdrop blur
2. Dedicated Pages (Deep Dive)

Full-page breed details at /breed/:id
Comprehensive information with multiple image galleries
Advanced characteristics with progress bars
Similar breed recommendations
Modal Trigger Flow
// Results component manages modal state
const [selectedBreed, setSelectedBreed] = useState<Breed | null>(null);
// Breed card click opens modal
onClick={() => setSelectedBreed(breed)}
// Modal renders conditionally
{selectedBreed && (
  <BreedModal 
    breed={selectedBreed}
    isOpen={!!selectedBreed}
    onClose={() => setSelectedBreed(null)}
  />
)}
Modal Design Features
Visual Elements:

Semi-transparent backdrop (bg-black/80)
Smooth animations with CSS transitions
Responsive layout (2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile)
Scrollable content for overflow handling
Focus trapping for accessibility
Content Structure:

Left panel: High-quality breed image + quick facts grid
Right panel: Detailed characteristics with progress bars
Header: Breed name with accessible close button
Interactive elements: All focusable with proper ARIA labels
Advanced Features
Smart Image System
Your app implements a sophisticated 3-tier image fallback system:

Custom Images (Highest priority) - Your 1500+ professional photos
TheDog API (Secondary) - Professional breed photography with rate limiting
Placeholder Images (Fallback) - Ensures no broken images
Progress Bar Revolution
You've replaced traditional dot ratings with modern horizontal progress bars:

// Each trait shows as visual progress bar with percentage
<div className="w-full bg-slate-200 rounded-full h-2.5">
  <div 
    className="h-2.5 rounded-full transition-all duration-300 bg-orange-500"
    style={{ width: `${(rating / 5) * 100}%` }}
  />
</div>
Heat Sensitivity Innovation
Your recent update changed "Temperature Tolerance" to "Heat Sensitivity" with inverted logic - cold-climate breeds like Bernese Mountain Dogs now correctly show as highly heat-sensitive.

Recommendation Algorithm
Your matching system uses weighted scoring across multiple factors:

Living Situation (20% weight) - Apartment vs house compatibility
Activity Level (25% weight) - Energy level matching
Experience Level (15% weight) - Training difficulty consideration
Family Factors (25% weight) - Kids and pets compatibility
Preferences (15% weight) - Size and grooming tolerance
Results display with color-coded match percentages:

90%+ = Green (Excellent match)
75%+ = Yellow (Good match)
<75% = Orange (Fair match)
Design System Excellence
Color Psychology
Warm Orange (#f97316) as primary - conveys friendliness and energy
Deep Orange (#ea580c) for interactions - maintains brand consistency
Gradient backgrounds create visual depth and modern appeal
Typography Hierarchy
5xl headlines (48px) for hero impact
3xl titles (30px) for section headers
Base body (16px) for readability
Small labels (14px) for metadata
Component Patterns
Rounded corners throughout for friendly aesthetic
Subtle shadows for depth perception
Hover animations with scale transforms
Progress visualization instead of static ratings
This architecture creates an intuitive, engaging experience that guides users from initial interest through breed discovery to informed decision-making, all while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility standards.
